    <section name="About Transform Tool">
      <p>The Transform Tool project contains software for transforming PDS3 and PDS4 product labels and product data into other formats. The following transformations are currently supported:

        <tr><td>PDS3 Image<br/>(8-bit Image)<br/>(16-bit Image)</td><td>GIF, JPEG, JPEG 2000, PNG, PNM, TIFF</td><td>Known limitations:<br/>- Does not yet support product labels referencing multiple images, including explicit FILE objects<br/>- Does not yet support Qube objects</td></tr>
